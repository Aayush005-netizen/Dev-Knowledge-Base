📘 Working with JSON & SQL — Notes

This folder contains my notes and example code on working with JSON files and SQL databases in Python.
It includes sample scripts, data files, and explanations of how I parsed JSON, stored data, and interacted with a database — all learned while following the tutorial video.

The goal is to capture the core ideas and practice code so I can revisit them later when working with structured data sources.

🧠 What I Did

In this section I learned how to:

Understand JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

What JSON is and why it’s used.

How JSON represents structured data in nested objects and lists.

Parse JSON in Python

Used Python’s json library to load JSON data.

Converted JSON into Python dictionaries/lists.

Accessed and manipulated fields inside JSON.

Interacting with SQL Databases

Learned how to connect to a SQL database from Python.

Used a SQL library (mysql.connector) to create and interact with tables.

Inserted data into tables from Python.

Queried data with SELECT, WHERE, etc.

Combined JSON + SQL

Read structured data from a JSON file.

📌 Concepts Covered

✔ Python json library
✔ SQL basics (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT)
✔ Python DB API (sqlite3 or similar)
✔ Reading -> Saving -> Querying structured data

❓ What I Learned

JSON is great for storing structured, nested data.

You can load JSON directly into Python data structures.

SQL databases help organize tabular data for querying.

Combining JSON parsing and SQL lets you store and query complex datasets.

Stored it into a SQL table.

Queried and used that data in Python scripts.

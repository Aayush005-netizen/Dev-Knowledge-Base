Dev Knowledge Base is a personal repository used to store my programming notes, experiments, and learning resources as I explore different areas of computer science and software development.

This repository does not follow a fixed syllabus. Instead, it grows organically as I learn new concepts, try new ideas, and document useful patterns, explanations, and code snippets.

The goal is to build a long-term learning archive that helps me revise concepts, understand fundamentals better, and track my growth as a developer.
